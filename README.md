<h1>ML project - Tennis Match Prediction</h1>

The purpose of this project is to predict a tennis match result based on previous match statistics.

For the training of our ML machine, we used Jeff Sackmann's datasets (can be found here: https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp). More specifically, we gathered data of ATP singles matches for the period 2010-2019 and combined them into one single .csv file (stats.csv). Later, data cleaning and feature engineering were implemented in order for our ML models to be trained and tested.
